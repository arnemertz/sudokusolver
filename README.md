# Modernizing a sudoku solver

During a workshop for modern C++, the trainees decided to do a coding challenge using C++14/17.
Since we were not interested in spending too much time on solving the design challenge itself, we decided to copy an existing C++ solution (as in "C with classes") and modernize it.
This repository shows a way from the orignal not-so-modern C++ code to a more modern style.
Check out the individual commits, including commit messages, for the stepwise refactoring.

The original code by "rathbhupendra" can be found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sudoku-backtracking-7/
